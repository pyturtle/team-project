Use the materials and tools you've gathered to validate your design and identify potential issues early, focusing on the core ideas rather than the complete final product.",

    "question": "Tell me more about the research process",
    "response": "The research process typically involves several key stages. It starts with identifying a research problem or question, which often comes from existing literature, observations, or practical needs. This is followed by a literature review, where you explore what is already known about the topic to understand current knowledge, identify gaps, and refine your research question. Next, you define your research objectives and develop a methodology, which includes choosing a research design (e.g., experimental, correlational, qualitative), identifying your participants or data sources, and selecting data collection methods (e.g., surveys, interviews, experiments, observations). After developing the methodology, you collect the data according to your plan. Once data is collected, it needs to be analyzed, often using statistical methods for quantitative data or thematic analysis for qualitative data, to extract meaningful insights. Finally, you interpret your findings in relation to your research question and objectives, draw conclusions, and communicate your results, usually through a written report, presentation, or publication. This process is often iterative, with steps potentially being revisited as new insights emerge.",
